# giqhub

giqhub is a free, open-source service that allows you to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on GitHub repositories.

## How it works

giqhub is a simple service that lets you perform RAG on any public GitHub repository. Just replace the 't' in 'github' with a 'q' in the URL, and you're good to go!

For example, if you want to perform RAG on the repository `https://github.com/owner/repo`, you would use the following URL: `https://giqhub.com/owner/repo`.
